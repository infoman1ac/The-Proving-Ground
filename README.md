# My Commitment

I am dedicating 3 months to becoming a top tier frontend developer and writer. 

"I have been held back by a fear of looking like a novice and a dependency on tools that have prevented me from learning. This repository is my public proving ground where I will document my journey of building and writing, daily and imperfectly. I will hold myself accountable here."
